## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
-   Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
