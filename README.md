## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

-   Distinguish between "unread" and "read" notifications
-   Select "Mark all as read" to toggle the visual state of the unread notifications and set the number of unread messages to zero
-   View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
-   See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 & CSS3
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Sass
-   Javascript
-   NodeJS
-   NPM
-   Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
    color: papayawhip;
}
```

```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
    console.log("ðŸŽ‰");
};
```

### Continued development

-   Convert to a React Component

### Useful resources

-   [MDN Pseudo Selector Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#alphabetical_index) - This helped me in finding the 'has' selector to specifically target a parent element that has a children with a certain attributes.
-   [Sass Reference](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes#alphabetical_index) - This helped me in setting up sass compilation with a script instead of the CLI
-   [NodeJS FS module](https://nodejs.dev/en/learn/writing-files-with-nodejs/) - This helped me in figuring out how to write the compiled sass into a css file.
